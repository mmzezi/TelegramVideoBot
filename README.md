# TelegramVideoBot
Basic bot for Telegram that downloads and uploads videos (powered by ffmpeg and yt-dlp)

## Usage
Replace the API key in your code with the API key of your bot (provided by BotFather).
Run the bot using `python3 bot.py`.

Download a video using `/download_video <video_url>`.
Download audio using `/download_audio <video_url>`.

## Issues
At the moment the bot has trouble parsing videos with colons in the title. WIP.
